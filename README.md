## Mission
This tool quickly locates food pantries and organizes the information into a list. We want to make it easy for people to find the resources they need to feed themselves and their families.

Currently, if a person needs assistance in finding food services, they must do so over the phone with 2-1-1 or through an established connection with a social worker. These methods are reliable sources of care, but are time-consuming for the user, and hunger can't wait. We seek to expedite the search process with an easy-to-use tool that anyone with an internet connection can access.

Our program utilizes web-scraping to collect and organize data from google maps. We offer two visualizations of the data: a list and a weekly schedule. A user can choose to save the information as a PDF for future reference.

## Existing Features
- Asks the user for a location and queries google maps' api for food pantries in the area.

## Upcoming Features
- Allow user to filter results by distance.
- Allow user to edit the data for inaccuracies or missing details.
